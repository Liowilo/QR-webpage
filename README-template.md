## My process

I think the first thing of the process of this website is learning how to start building the code in a responsive way, like, the first view is suppose to be the phone, so i did it, and is interesting start from that way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn a lot of de css display flex property, and how to use depending of the situation.



### Continued development

I want to focus in de development of the property grid and flex in css, beacuse i think is one of the most importan things that i can lear in the course of my career.
